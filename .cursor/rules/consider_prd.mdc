# Reference the PRD in All Development Work

Always refer to and consider the Product Requirements Document (PRD) located at `docs/capture-the-pub-prd.md` when:
- Making any code changes or architectural decisions
- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs or addressing edge cases
- Reviewing or refactoring existing code
- Answering questions about game rules, user flows, or requirements

The PRD defines the core game mechanics, user roles, technical constraints, and project goals. Ensure all implementations align with the PRD specifications.

## Key Principles from PRD
- Mobile-first design only (no desktop optimization)
- Real-time updates for all players
- Low-friction, honour-system based rules
- Game never ends automatically - only admin can toggle game state
- First valid submission wins for captures
- All players see all activity feed items
